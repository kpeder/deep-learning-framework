## 3. Use a product license

Date: 2024-10-30

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Without a software license of some sort, all users of this framework are liable to all contributors, as a group and individually, including the contributors themselves. Rather than open ourselves up to such matters of copyright and litigation, we should select a license.

Some options are available [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/).

The preference for this project is to have a permissive license, but one that absolves contributors of liability.

### Decision
1. The framework shall use the [Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/) license.

### Consequences
1. Anyone can use the framework.
1. No one can blame contributors if the use of the framework goes sideways.
