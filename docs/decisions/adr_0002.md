## 2. All features include tests

Date: 2024-10-28

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Features included in the product should be tested to ensure that functionality meets expectations and regressions are not introduced over time.

This approach increases the quality of the product and provides a consistent benchmark for its expected operation.

This approach provides a foundation for the practice of Test Driven Development (TDD) and its variations, such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

### Decision
1. New software features must include functional unit tests.
1. Test coverage must remain above 60%, and should remain above 70%.

### Consequences
1. Test additions or updates will need to be included with all Pull Requests that introduce new features.
1. All classes, methods, and function definitions should have at least on associated unit test.
